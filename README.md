# zmqToTar1090

zmqToTar1090 proxies traffic from a Sniffle receiver (https://github.com/alphafox02/Sniffle) to JSON data formatted for ingestion into tar1090. A lot of this project was borrowed from alphafox (cemaexecutor)

## Features

## Requirements
- Sniffle compatible dongle
- tar1090 with local mountpoint to /run/readsb (use docker - https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090)
- python3

## Setup and Usage

### Setup tar1090 for drone ingestion

#### readsb modification

I haven't tested running this at the same time as ADSB input, so for now you'll need to add the following line to the top of the readsb script that's within the tar1090 project (https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-tar1090/blob/main/rootfs/etc/s6-overlay/scripts/readsb)

```exec sleep infinity```

This makes it so even if readsb isn't running, the drone decoding will still work.

#### Dockerfile

- Append `TAR1090_CONFIGJS_APPEND='droneJson="./data/drone.json"'` to the ENV section of the docker-tar1090 Dockerfile

#### Docker Compose

- Append `TAR1090_CONFIGJS_APPEND='droneJson="./data/drone.json"'` to the "environment" section of the docker-compose-tar1090.yml file

### Clone Sniffle from alphafox02 repo (this it the one I used, you can likely use the one he forked from kerler)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alphafox02/Sniffle
cd Sniffle
```

### Run sniffle providing ZMQ output
```sh
python3 Sniffle/python_cli/sniff_receiver -l -e -z --zmqhost 127.0.0.1 --zmqport 2402
```

This command configures the Sniffle dongle to look for Bluetooth 5 long range extended packets and forwards them via ZeroMQ (ZMQ).

### Start the zmqToTar1090 proxy with the expected ZMQ server/port information.

The following command specifies the ZMQ host and ZMQ port that are default

```sh
python3 zmqToTar1090.py --zmq-host 127.0.0.1 --zmqport 24042
```

This will create a `drone.json` file in the /run/readsb directory for ingestion into tar1090 The path will be parameterized soon.

You can use ```python3 zmqToTar10909.py --help``` to show runtime arguments

## Testing

I created a separate script you can run if you don't yet have a Sniffle compatible dongle. You'll still need tar1090 and the zmqToTar1090 script.
